iTMS Introduction
===================

iTMS can manage requirement, feature, performance setting, Testcase, Testsuite and Testplan and their related attributes,
such as type, subsystem, category and component. The relations between Testcase, Testsuite and Testplan also can be
edited in iTMS.

The Report parts show test results in chart and table. Function report lists results of testplans with performance is
False, and Performance report presents results of testplans with performance is True. Each testplan generates an
execution once it is executed, except undated testplan in function report. In order to get the difference between
executions, iTMS supports executions comparison.
